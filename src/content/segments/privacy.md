Brainstorm is built so that the people designing it cannot read what you write — and so that we couldn't comply with a request to hand it over even if we wanted to.

## What that means concretely

- **Local-first by default.** Your vault is a directory on your disk. We don't have a copy. We don't have access. There is nothing to subpoena.

- **No account required.** You can use Brainstorm for a decade without creating an account. The optional hosted relay (Plus / Pro plans, v2) is end-to-end encrypted between your devices; the relay can route ciphertext, not read it.

- **AI calls are brokered.** Every AI call goes through the shell's AI broker, which enforces per-app budgets and provenance. The local model bundled with the shell runs offline — no plaintext leaves your machine unless you authorise it.

- **Credentials live in the OS keystore.** Apps cannot reach the keystore directly; only the credential broker in the main process can. The threat model is documented.

## What we will not claim

We don't claim "untraceable" — nothing on a networked device is. We don't claim "fully anonymous" — DNS and your IP are still visible. We don't claim "your data is *yours*" with three exclamation marks. Crypto-maximalist marketing sounds like every shovelware privacy app.

We use precise language because precise language is less common in this space and reads as more credible.

## What to read before trusting us

- [Security and sandbox model](https://docs.getbrainstorm.online/build/capabilities)
- [Identity, organisations, and encryption](https://docs.getbrainstorm.online/concepts/your-data-and-security)
- [Credential storage](https://docs.getbrainstorm.online/concepts/your-data-and-security)
- [AI foundations](https://docs.getbrainstorm.online/apps/agent)

If something there doesn't match what the running product does, file an issue. We'll fix one or the other.
