The short version: the shell is an **Electron + IPC + capability-ledger host**. Apps are **sandboxed renderers** with declared capabilities and a fixed-depth per-app pending queue. **Yjs** is the CRDT. **SQLite + FTS5** is the store. **Block Protocol** is the interop. **Lexical** powers rich text. The full architecture is in `docs/foundations/02-architecture.md`.

## Why you might care

- **The IPC envelope is a real contract.** Every host-service call goes through `{v, msg, app, service, method, args, caps}`. The broker validates structure, verifies the preload-stamped app id, checks capabilities against the per-vault ledger, and forwards to a service handler. Fail-closed; capability misses return `Unavailable`, not approval.

- **The SDK is real.** Manifest, capabilities, host services, versioning — all in `docs/apps/08-app-sdk.md`. The Code app lets you write a Brainstorm app from inside Brainstorm. Build, install, debug — all in-product. The capability surface is documented.

- **Storage is local-first, repo-pattern, and runtime-agnostic.** `bun:sqlite` under tests, `better-sqlite3` in production. No inline SQL outside repos. Yjs persistence is snapshot+tail with per-update CRC32; compaction at 256 KiB tail.

- **Workers everywhere.** `utilityProcess.fork`-based workers handle storage and Yjs. The Broker hands envelopes to a `WorkerBridge`. App authors get Web Worker / SharedWorker patterns with a Worker SDK shim.
