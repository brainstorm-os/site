You've been here before.

You used a local-first knowledge tool that started clean, accumulated features, and eventually became hard to evolve because everything was interconnected. Data, sync, UI, schema, and product surface fused into a single mass. Every change rippled.

You walked away — not because the team was wrong, but because the architecture was a trap.

Brainstorm is a deliberate retry, built by people who watched that pattern develop firsthand. The central organising principle is **separation**: the shell hosts apps, apps interoperate only through standard contracts, and the schema is owned by no one app.

That is the difference. It is the only difference that matters at year five.

## What this looks like in practice

- **Adding an app does not require touching the shell.** A PDF editor is its own app. Removing it leaves documents that referenced it readable (they degrade to a default block view, not an error).

- **Two apps that handle the same kind of data don't fight.** Multiple apps can read and write entities of the same type. No one app is "the owner" of a type.

- **Customisations are personal by default.** Database views, dashboard layouts, shortcut bindings, theme — all scoped to you, with an explicit "share with team" affordance when you want it. The shared workspace stays clean.

## What we are not

We're not "X but better." We are different. The credibility we want to earn is not the credibility of being a successor. It's the credibility of being honest about what shape we are.
